	There is no special hardware consideration except that you need an internet connection. You need to have Windows or Mac OS, or a Linux version to work on the project.
	In order to be able to edit the application code efficiently, we recommend using a text editor such as Notepad ++(Windows), Textmate or Sublime (Mac OS).

Known Issues:
	1.	Heroku hosting service doesn’t allow to keep user uploaded files for a long time, files will only stay for an hour and half maximum, unless a paid subscription is purchased. 
	The first option to solve this issue is by acquiring a paid Heroku subscription, which can be done through https://get.heroku.com/pricing. 
	The second option to solve this issue is to use an Amazon S3 storage server to store uploaded files. A helpful guide to how this could be done can be found on https://github.com/jnicklas/carrierwave#using-amazon-s3
